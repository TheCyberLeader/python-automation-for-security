🛠️ Identifying and interpreting vulnerabilities in small business environments with governance context.

**Project Title**: *Small Business Vulnerability Identification & Mitigation*

**Project Introduction**: I conducted a vulnerability assessment of a fictional small business network using open-source tools. The goal was to identify common security gaps and offer actionable remediation steps.

**Modeling and Evaluation**: Scanning tools simulated vulnerability detection; issues were prioritized using CVSS scoring.

**Conclusion**: Findings focused on patch management and legacy software exposure. Future steps include mapping vulnerabilities to business risk and introducing mitigation workflows.
